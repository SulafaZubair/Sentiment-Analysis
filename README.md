# Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews

## Project Overview
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews, classifying them as either positive or negative. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, this project seeks to gain insights into public sentiment regarding films.

## Objectives
- To classify movie reviews into positive and negative sentiments.
- To explore and preprocess text data for better analysis.
- To evaluate the effectiveness of the sentiment classification model.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews/data)

## Project Steps

1. **Dataset Acquisition**
   - Download the dataset from the provided Kaggle link.

2. **Data Loading**
   - Utilize the Pandas library to load the dataset into a DataFrame.

3. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Perform the following preprocessing steps:
     - Tokenization: Split text into individual words or tokens.
     - Remove stopwords: Eliminate common words that do not contribute to sentiment.
     - Stemming/Lemmatization: Reduce words to their base or root forms using NLTK.
   - Convert the cleaned text data into numerical format using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).

4. **Model Building**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
   - Implement a classification model using either Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes.
   - Train the model on the training data and predict sentiments on the test set.

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the model's performance using the following metrics:
     - Accuracy
     - Precision
     - Recall
     - F1-score
   - Visualize the sentiment distribution to understand the overall trends in the reviews.

6. **Documentation**
   - Document the modeling process, findings, and results in a Jupyter Notebook or a comprehensive report.

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following packages installed:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
